# Guess-the-number
## Inspiration
The inspiration behind "Guess the Number" came from the simplicity and universal appeal of classic number guessing games. I aimed to create a fun and interactive experience that users could enjoy directly from the command line interface.
## What it does
"Guess the Number" is a command line game where players try to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to help players refine their guesses until they correctly identify the target number.
## How we built it
We built "Guess the Number" using JavaScript and GitHub Copilot.
## Challenges we ran into
One significant challenge i encountered was managing user input and ensuring the game provided clear instructions and feedback. Additionally, handling edge cases such as invalid inputs required careful consideration to maintain the game's integrity.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud to have created a fully functional game using JavaScript, especially as it represents our first foray into game development with the language. 
## What we learned
Through building "Guess the Number," I deepened our understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including user input handling, random number generation, and conditional logic. 
## What's next for Guess the number
In the future, I plan to enhance "Guess the Number" by adding features such as difficulty levels, score tracking, and a graphical user interface for a more immersive gaming experience. I also aim to optimize the codebase and explore additional JavaScript functionalities to further improve the game.
